## Native video

The portrait video opens around 0 to 3 seconds, closes around 4 to 7, reopens around 8 to 11, closes again around 12 to 15, and reopens around 16 to 19. Blur builds toward the top while the bottom remains readable longer.

The landscape launch video contains three physical close/open cycles through approximately 23 seconds. Frames at 10.5 and 11.25 seconds show the key distinction: content still fills nearly the entire physical screen height. The top narrows mildly, the upper content blurs progressively, and dark corners deepen. The menu bar and Dock stay sharp and anchored. Some apparent perspective comes from the camera viewing the physical lid, so it must not be duplicated as software rotation.

The final portion of that video shows a separate website miniature. Its 72-degree rotation, 1400-pixel perspective, and large top-edge fade create an intentionally collapsing card. Earlier prototype versions incorrectly transferred that geometry to the real desktop. Local prototype recordings showed the resulting mismatch: a large black area opened above a heavily compressed desktop.

## Current reconstruction

The new projection keeps the top and bottom edges at their original height. Its homogeneous horizontal taper grows from zero to a maximum top-edge inset of approximately 11.5 percent on each side. This is a visual approximation of the native footage, not a recovered native coefficient.

Three cached Gaussian blur levels at nominal widths of 6, 16, and 36 pixels per 786-pixel reference width provide continuous progressive blur. Blur strength varies with closure and fades toward the lower tenth of the desktop. Subtle top-corner shading and side feathering complete the single effect. The side gaps extend the nearest desktop edge using the cached broad blur texture, with a soft blend into the folded image. An inverse projection in the fragment shader preserves the fold geometry while covering the full overlay. This adds no capture, blur pass, or intermediate texture.

The effect covers the built-in screen's usable desktop area, excluding the normal menu bar and Dock. A non-activating panel joins fullscreen Spaces without taking keyboard focus. Space changes refresh the capture area: fullscreen content uses the whole display, while the regular desktop keeps the menu bar and Dock stationary.

## Motion timing

The default open position is 100 degrees. The calibration button captures a comfortable viewing angle and saves it across launches. Enabling the effect does not overwrite the chosen position. The baseline stays fixed while the user holds the lid partly closed and is retained across sleep and capture reinitialization. Following the open angle is optional and on by default. The baseline then moves to whatever angle the lid settles at, once a reading holds within 1.5 degrees for 750 ms and the lid sits at least three degrees above its lowest recent reading. That travel requirement keeps a pause during a close from being read as a new open position, which a single degree threshold could not do because adjacent-degree sensor noise alone would satisfy it. Adoption changes the baseline without resetting the filter, so the damped response glides the fold to rest instead of snapping. Angles below 25 degrees are ignored, matching the manual calibration guard.

The input is a stream of integer-degree readings. A 0.6-degree noise band prevents alternating adjacent readings from constantly moving the target. Angular velocity is estimated with a 60 ms time constant. Prediction looks ahead by 35 ms and is limited to 0.75 degrees. Closure is mapped from the calibrated baseline toward eight degrees.

A critically damped second-order filter maintains continuous position and velocity. Its response increases from 30 to 55 radians per second as estimated motion speeds up. The output keeps its direction between readings until the sensor indicates a reversal. This avoids small backward corrections from decaying predictions. Long gaps between rendered frames reset the integration step, preventing an initial jump after resting. Enabling the effect seeds the filter at the closure implied by the current angle, so a session that starts while the lid is partly closed unwinds from that fold instead of animating into it.

There is no fixed playback timeline or additional SwiftUI animation in the motion path. The speed-dependent smoothing follows the general principle described by the [1 Euro filter authors](https://github.com/casiez/OneEuroFilter), using stronger smoothing at low speeds. The implementation uses a damped second-order response rather than that library's first-order filter.

The sensor reads feature reports on a dedicated queue at 120 Hz while the effect is enabled and 10 Hz while disabled. It does not wait for input notifications, which did not track physical movement reliably. Repeated readings still advance the estimator clock; consecutive failed reads clear the effect instead of leaving an old position on screen. A view-owned display link schedules drawing at a steady 60 Hz, passing the expected presentation timestamp to the motion estimator. MTKView remains in explicit-draw mode so only that display link controls cadence. Captured content arrives separately at up to 60 fps. The selected draw cadence avoids repeated drawable stalls observed when requesting 120 Hz. A synthetic run measured 16.67 ms average frame spacing and 16.79 ms at the 95th percentile, with a first motion draw taking 1.10 ms on the CPU. These are local rendering measurements, not sensor-to-display latency. Each newly captured frame generates cached GPU blur levels; lid movement only changes the final projection and blur blend. The renderer reuses the latest content and does not wait for a new capture frame to move.

The previous 12 ms first-order filter followed individual degree changes too closely. High rendering frame rates did not eliminate the visible stair-step input. The current motion filter smooths position and velocity together and suppresses quantization jitter. A synthetic replay checks slow and fast closure at 30, 60, and 120 input samples per second, held adjacent-degree noise, and reopening. A second replay covers open angle adoption: a jittering hold partway through a close adopts nothing, reparking the lid adopts the new angle, and the fold then unwinds through the damped response rather than snapping.

Before On appears, an offscreen GPU pass initializes the blur textures, Gaussian kernels, and fold pipeline, and capture supplies its first frame. A transparent window stays ordered at rest with drawing paused, so closing does not need to allocate a new window surface. The first 2.5 percent of closure smoothly blends the captured image into the live desktop. At full reopening, a transparent frame is presented before drawing pauses.

These checks do not measure physical end-to-end latency, which also depends on the sensor, capture, GPU, and display.

## Capture at rest

macOS shows its screen recording indicator for as long as a capture stream runs, and an app cannot suppress it. Pausing capture at rest is optional and on by default. The stream stops three seconds after the fold returns to rest and a new one is built when the next fold begins, so the indicator tracks lid movement instead of staying lit for the whole session.

The renderer keeps its last frame across a pause, so a fold starts on retained content while the new stream spins up rather than waiting on capture. The content filter and stream configuration are cached, which lets a resume skip shareable content enumeration and the blur warm up. Included windows are refreshed once the resumed stream is running. Turning the option off keeps a single stream running for the whole session, which is the earlier behavior.

## Implementation reference

[LidAngleSensor](https://github.com/samhenrigold/LidAngleSensor) supplies the observed HID identifiers and feature-report layout. Hinge reads the little-endian angle through IOKit. Exact native Bendy shader parameters and sensor timing remain unavailable.

## Recovery

Sensor loss cancels both startup and active capture. Switching Spaces uses the full display frame directly, without enumerating shareable content. Capture restarts only when the display area changes. Wake recovery polls the sensor every 50 ms for up to five seconds and retries the connection once per second, so a session restarts early enough to animate the reopening that follows a full close. Duplicate wake notifications do not interrupt an active session. Turning Hinge off cancels pending recovery.
