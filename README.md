# Hinge

Give your MacBook desktop a little bend. Close the lid and watch your screen softly fold and blur. Open it and everything comes back.

## For the nerds

Hinge reads the lid angle 120 times a second and turns it into a continuous animation. Slow tilt, slow bend. Quick tilt, quick bend. A little smoothing takes the steps out of whole-degree sensor readings.

ScreenCaptureKit supplies your live desktop, and Metal adds perspective and progressive blur at 60 fps. Everything stays in memory on your Mac. No recordings, no uploads.

## Install

Requires an Apple silicon MacBook with a supported lid sensor and macOS 14 or later.

[Download Hinge](https://hinge.noveum.ai/download), open the DMG, and drag Hinge into Applications. This prototype is not notarized; macOS may ask you to approve it under Privacy & Security.

Prefer building it yourself? Grab Xcode, then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Noveum/hinge.git
cd hinge
make build
open build/Hinge.app
```

Allow Screen Recording, reopen Hinge if prompted, and turn it on. By default Hinge treats whatever angle you settle at as your open position, so wherever you park the lid stays clear and only closing from there folds. Prefer one fixed angle? Turn off **Follow my open angle**, get comfy, and click **Set open position**. Hinge remembers.

Hinge also pauses capture while the lid rests, so the macOS recording indicator only lights up while your desktop is actually folding. That indicator is drawn by the system and no app can hide it.
